## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: TTS must use audio element, not SpeechSynthesis (screen reader conflict)
- [Roadmap]: Voice loop uses strict state machine (idle|listening|processing|speaking|error)
- [Roadmap]: Photo capture via input[type=file][capture=environment] for accessibility
- [Roadmap]: All menu photos in single Claude Vision call for cross-page context
- [Roadmap]: Full menu JSON in system prompt (~3-5K tokens, no summarization)
- [Roadmap]: Streaming + sentence buffering for TTS latency reduction

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- iOS Safari VoiceOver is primary test target -- need real device testing from Phase 2 onward
- Web Speech API is Chrome/Edge/Safari only -- Firefox users excluded in v1
